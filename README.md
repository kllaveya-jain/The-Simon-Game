# The-Simon-Game
A replication of the popular Simon Game.

The Simon game is an electronic game in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. Keep track of your score as you challenge friends or try to beat your own high score.
